                        <h2>Statistics of Sustainable Cities</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The pandemic has worsened the situation of the people that are living in slums or poorly built homes. The majority of people who live in slums are from 3 regions</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>16% of the urban area that people live in contain streets and open public spaces</li>
                            <li>A billion people live in slums in mostly these three places. 370 million come from Eastern and south-eastern asia, 238 million come from sub-saharan africa, and 226 million are from central and southern asia</li>
                            <li>There are currently 156 countries have developed national urban policies, but less than half of them are in the implementation stage</li>
                            <li>Only half of the world's population has access to convenient access to public transport. CONVENIENT ACCESS means living within 500m of walking distance from a bus-stop, and 1000m from a railway</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Outside the United States</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Most of Asia is very under developed, at least 1 billion people out of the 3 billion that live in Asia live in the slums of are completely homeless. Most notably the countries of North Korea, China, India and way more. They need access to advanced medicare so they can be treated when something health related happens to them.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Most people in Southern Africa don't have good access to clean water, they often have to walk really far to get their clean water, and when they get their clean water, its only 5 gallons and that has to last their entire day for everything they do, whether it is clean themselves or drinking or doing dishes. And most of the time that water is very dirty, and contains tons of parasites. Currently, most of the coronavirus cases that are happening are people that currently live in slums, because they dont have acces to doctors are treatment facilities. If they are badly sick, most people just die on the streets.</p>
                        <p class="lead">This needs to stop, in 2019, the United Nations made 17 Sustainable Development Goals that should be solved or done by 2030, but this can't be done without the coorperation of the entire world and the people living in those communities. Everyone will need to pitch in to achieve these goals to transform the world and make the future a better place for the generations to come.</p>

                        <h2>How you and everyone can help!</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The United Nations needs everyone's help to meet these Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, and SDG #11 is no exception. People arent able to participate in their community not because they don't want to, but because they can't. People don't have access to public transportation that aren't remotely close to them. They have to walk everywhere that they have to go, whether it is the supermarket or school.</p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            The best way to contribute is to donate to anyone or anything that will help them find a better place to live and help them get back on their feet. Any donation, whether it is big or small will help. You can also volunteer in slums to help with building houses, fixing existing ones, setting up public or green spaces. You can also manage what you do at home, for example try to reduce the amount of food wasted in your households, so that there could be more food for the people currently living in the slums. Try using less water than you normally use in a day, take showers instead of bath, and use dishwashers instead of using sponges and doing it manually, because that wastes more water. Also try to use public transport when it is avaliable to you, although it may be more inconveient, it conributes to other SDGs to develop public transport, not only does it reduce carbon emissions, but it provides better access to education, sustainable energy, decent work and
                            equality between people.
